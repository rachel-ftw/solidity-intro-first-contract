# Intro to Solidity & Writing/Deploying your First Contract

For Oakland Blockchain Developers: A class going over the basics of the solidity language &amp; developing/ deploying your first contract.

Web3 1.0 is only in beta and I had some trouble calling my function from a deployed contract. You can follow the instructions in `walkthrough-web3-1.0beta.md`. If you want to walk through on a non-beta version, follow the instructions in `walkthrough-web3.0.19.0.md`

Shout out to [Decypher](decypher.tv), got the 0.19 version instructions from him. His videos are awesome!
